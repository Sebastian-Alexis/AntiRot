# **Anti Rot**

Anti Rot is a webapp that translates Gen Z/Alpha slang into understandable text. By default, it takes from the [Wikipedia Glossary of Gen Z slang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Generation_Z_slang), but users can put any wikipedia glossary of slang, no matter the time period.

## **Features**

- **Input Text Translation**: Converts slang into understandable language using definitions based on a wikipedia glossary.
- **Smooth and Natural Output**: Uses together.ai API so that translated text is not unnatural or lacking context.
- **Explanations**: Provides justifications for translation choices in an explanation section. Also explains a bit of history behind the slang to give the user a better understanding of the translation.
- **Modern UI**: Built with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for a sleek, responsive design.
